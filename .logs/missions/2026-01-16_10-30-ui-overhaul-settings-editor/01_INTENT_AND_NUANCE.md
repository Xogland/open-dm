# Mission: UI/UX Overhaul for Settings and Chat Flow Editor

## Intent

Overhaul the UI/UX for Organization Settings, User Settings, and the Chat Flow Editor's properties panel (specifically the Payment type). The goal is to move from basic forms to a premium, "wow" factor design that feels modern, cohesive, and high-end.

## Boundary Decisions

- **Consistency**: All settings pages will share a unified layout language (Sidebar + Content Area).
- **Aesthetics**: Follow "Premium Designs" guidelines. Use HSL-tailored colors, glassmorphism, and Inter/Outfit typography.
- **Functional Goal**: Not just a visual skin, but improving the *flow* and *clarity* of information.
- **Payment Overhaul**: Introduce "Payment Type" selection in the properties panel to allow for more flexible payment configurations.

## Nuance Track

- **Interactive States**: Use Framer Motion (or simple CSS transitions if not available) for smoother transitions.
- **Empty States**: Design better "select something to see properties" views.
- **Validation**: Ensure all inputs feel responsive and provide immediate feedback.
