                question: "How does OpenDM's paid conversation feature work?",
                answer: "For consultants, creators, and coaches, you can set a fee for specific inquiry types (e.g., \"Paid Consultation Request,\" \"Priority Support,\" \"Sponsorship Pitch\"). When a visitor selects that intent, they pay the fee via Stripe before their message is sent. 100% of the payment goes to your connected Stripe account—OpenDM charges 0% platform fees on paid inquiries. This turns your contact link into a revenue channel."
            },
            {
                question: "Can I use my own domain with OpenDM?",
                answer: "Yes. With OpenDM, you can either use your free opendm.io/yourname link or, on any paid plan, connect your own custom domain (e.g., contact.yourbrand.com). This provides a fully branded, professional contact page that matches your website, enhancing trust and legitimacy for business inquiries."
            },
            {
                question: "Is there a free plan available?",
                answer: "Yes. OpenDM offers a FREE \"Launch\" plan that includes one profile, basic inquiry types, and 1GB storage. It's perfect for testing how structured contact management works. You can upgrade to PRO ($29/mo) for paid inquiries and team features or MAX ($69/mo) for advanced analytics and scaling."

                question: "What exactly is OpenDM?",
                answer: "OpenDM is your professional contact link that replaces chaotic inboxes. It's a structured contact portal where visitors choose their intent (business, sponsorship, paid advice) before messaging, ensuring you receive only qualified, actionable inquiries."
            },
            {
                question: "How is OpenDM different from a standard contact form or Linktree?",
                answer: "Traditional contact forms capture basic information. OpenDM captures intent and context before the conversation begins. Unlike Linktree which just lists links, OpenDM provides a complete contact gateway with qualification, routing, and monetization features—turning passive links into active conversion tools."
            },
            {
                question: "How quickly can I set up my OpenDM contact link?",
                answer: "You can create your professional contact link in under 2 minutes. Simply sign up, choose your handle (opendm.io/yourname), define your first inquiry type, and start sharing. Most users have their full contact portal running in under 10 minutes."
            },

                question: "Do I need technical skills to use OpenDM?",
                answer: "Not at all. OpenDM is designed for non-technical professionals. The intuitive dashboard guides you through setup, and our templates help you create effective inquiry flows without any coding or design skills required."
            },
            {
                question: "Can I use OpenDM on mobile?",
                answer: "Yes. OpenDM is fully responsive and works perfectly on all devices. You can manage inquiries, view conversations, and update settings from any smartphone or tablet through our mobile-optimized web interface."

                question: "What types of inquiries can I charge for with OpenDM?",
                answer: "Common monetized inquiries include: Paid consultations, Priority support access, Sponsorship pitches, Business partnership proposals, Expert advice sessions, Media interview requests, and Custom service inquiries. You can create unlimited paid inquiry types."
            },
            {
                question: "How do I get paid, and when do funds arrive?",
                answer: "Payments process instantly through Stripe. When someone pays for a conversation, 100% of the fee goes directly to your connected Stripe account. Funds typically arrive in your bank account within 2 business days, depending on your Stripe settings."
            },
            {
                question: "Are there any hidden fees for paid conversations?",
                answer: "No. OpenDM charges 0% platform fees on your revenue. You only pay your monthly subscription fee. Standard Stripe processing fees (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction) apply, which is standard for payment processing."
            },
            {
                question: "Can I offer both free and paid inquiry options?",
                answer: "Absolutely. This is a best practice. Most professionals offer 3-5 free inquiry paths (general questions, partnership ideas, press inquiries) alongside 2-3 paid options (priority support, consultations). This creates accessibility while monetizing high-value requests."
            },
            {
                question: "What if someone pays but I can't help them?",
                answer: "You maintain full control. If you receive a paid inquiry that you cannot fulfill, you can issue a full refund directly from your OpenDM dashboard. The conversation history remains, but the payment is returned to the sender."

                question: "Can I customize the questions for each inquiry type?",
                answer: "Yes. Each inquiry path can have completely customized questions. For sponsorship inquiries, ask about budget and timeline. For consultations, ask about goals and challenges. This qualification happens before the conversation starts, saving you time."
            },
            {
                question: "How does OpenDM's spam filtering actually work?",
                answer: "OpenDM filters spam through intent capture and structure. Spammers typically won't engage with multiple-choice questions or detailed inquiry paths. Additionally, paid inquiry requirements deter low-quality messages. Users report 90-99% reduction in spam."
